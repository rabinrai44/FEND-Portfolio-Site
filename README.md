# Nanodegree Front-End Web Developer - Personal Portfolio Site

## Project Description
A portfolio website. I've provided a design mockup as a PDF-file by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001), and I replicate that design in HTML and CSS. I develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions, and links to each of the portfolio projects. This is my first project for the Nanodegree program. I use own custom images to personalize this project and some of the images I copied from the third-party open source.

## Main Languages
